Overview
===========


PySPH is an open source framework for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations.  It is implemented in Python_ and the performance critical parts
are implemented in Cython_ and PyOpenCL_.

PySPH is implemented in a way that allows a user to specify the entire SPH
simulation in pure Python. High-performance code is generated from this
high-level Python code, compiled on the fly and executed. PySPH can use OpenMP
to utilize multi-core CPUs effectively. PySPH can work with OpenCL and use
your GPGPUs. PySPH also features optional automatic parallelization
(multi-CPU) using mpi4py_ and Zoltan_. If you wish to use the parallel
capabilities you will need to have these installed.

Here are videos of simulations made with PySPH.

SPH formulations
-----------------

Currently, PySPH has numerous examples to solve the viscous, incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations using the weakly compressible (WCSPH) approach. The
following formulations are currently implemented:

- `Weakly Compressible SPH (WCSPH)`_ for free-surface flows (Gesteira et al. 2010, Journal of Hydraulic Research, 48, pp. 6--27)

- `Transport Velocity Formulation`_ for incompressilbe fluids (Adami et al. 2013, JCP, 241, pp. 292--307).

--------
History
--------

- 2009: PySPH started with a simple Cython based 1D implementation written by
  Prabhu.

- 2009-2010: Chandrashekhar Kaushik worked on a full 3D SPH implementation with
  a more general purpose design.  The implementation was in a mix of Cython and
  Python.

- 2010-2012: The previous implementation was a little too complex and was
  largely overhauled by Kunal and Pankaj.  This became the PySPH 0.9beta
  release.  The difficulty with this version was that it was almost entirely
  written in Cython, making it hard to extend or add new formulations without
  writing more Cython code.  Doing this was difficult and not too pleasant.  In
  addition it was not as fast as we would have liked it. It ended up feeling
  like we might as well have implemented it all in C++ and exposed a Python
  interface to that.

- 2011-2012: Kunal also implemented SPH2D_ and another internal version called
  ZSPH in Cython which included Zoltan_ based parallelization using PyZoltan_.
  This was specific to his PhD research and again required writing Cython
  making it difficult for the average user to extend.

- 2013-present In early 2013, Prabhu reimplemented the core of PySPH to be
  almost entirely auto-generated from pure Python.  The resulting code was
  faster than previous implementations and very easy to extend entirely from
  pure Python.  Kunal and Prabhu integrated PyZoltan into PySPH and the current
  version of PySPH was born.  Subsequently, OpenMP support was also added in
  2015.
