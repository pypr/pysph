PySPH: a Python-based SPH framework
------------------------------------

|CI Status|  |MPI Build status|  |Documentation Status|


PySPH is an open source framework for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) simulations. It is implemented in
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ and the performance critical parts
are implemented in `Cython <http://www.cython.org>`_ and PyOpenCL_.

PySPH allows users to write their high-level code in pure Python. This Python
code is automatically converted to high-performance Cython or OpenCL which is
compiled and executed. PySPH can also be configured to work seamlessly with
OpenMP, OpenCL, and MPI.

The latest documentation for PySPH is available at
`pysph.readthedocs.org <http://pysph.readthedocs.org>`_.

Installation
-------------

Up-to-date details on how to install PySPH on Linux/OS X and Windows are
available from
`here <http://pysph.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html>`_.

If you wish to see a working build/test script please see our `shippable.yml
<https://github.com/pypr/pysph/blob/master/shippable.yml>`_. For
Windows platforms see the `appveyor.yml
<https://github.com/pypr/pysph/blob/master/appveyor.yml>`_.

Running the examples
--------------------

You can verify the installation by exploring some examples. A fairly
quick running example (taking about 20 seconds) would be the
following::

    $ pysph run elliptical_drop

This requires that Mayavi be installed. The saved output data can be
viewed by running::

    $ pysph view elliptical_drop_output/

A more interesting example would be a 2D dam-break example (this takes about 30
minutes in total to run)::

    $ pysph run dam_break_2d

The solution can be viewed live by running (on another shell)::

    $ pysph view

The generated output can also be viewed and the newly generated output files
can be refreshed on the viewer UI.

A 3D version of the dam-break problem is also available, and may be run
as::

    $ pysph run dam_break_3d

This runs the 3D dam-break problem which is also a SPHERIC benchmark
`Test 2 <https://wiki.manchester.ac.uk/spheric/index.php/Test2>`_

   :width: 550px
   :alt: Three-dimensional dam-break example

PySPH is more than a tool for wave-body interactions:::

    $ pysph run cavity

This runs the driven cavity problem using the transport velocity formulation of
Adami et al. The output directory ``cavity_output`` will also contain
streamlines and other post-processed results after the simulation completes.
For example the streamlines look like the following image:

.. figure:: https://github.com/pypr/pysph/raw/master/docs/Images/ldc-streamlines.png
   :width: 550px
   :alt: Lid-driven-cavity example

If you want to use PySPH for elastic dynamics, you can try some of the
examples from the ``pysph.examples.solid_mech`` package::

    $ pysph run solid_mech.rings

Which runs the problem of the collision of two elastic rings:

.. figure:: https://github.com/pypr/pysph/raw/master/docs/Images/rings-collision.png
   :width: 550px
   :alt: Collision of two steel rings

The auto-generated code for the example resides in the directory
``~/.pysph/source``. A note of caution however, it's not for the faint
hearted.

There are many more examples, they can be listed by simply running::

    $ pysph run

PySPH is primarily developed at the `Department of Aerospace
Engineering, IIT Bombay <http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in>`_. We are grateful
to IIT Bombay for their support.  Our primary goal is to build a
powerful SPH based tool for both application and research. We hope that
this makes it easy to perform reproducible computational research.
